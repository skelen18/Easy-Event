# EasyEvent

EasyEvent is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance the event management experience on your server. It is specifically developed for the RilyEvents server but can be used on other servers as well. While the plugin is still in development and may contain bugs, feedback from users is highly appreciated to help improve its functionality.

Currently, **EasyEvent** supports only the **Czech language**, and the English language support is not yet available. The plugin is also in the process of being configured so that users can customize their own settings, though this feature is not yet fully implemented. At the moment, it is mainly designed for use on the RilyEvents server.

## Features

EasyEvent offers a range of commands to help administrators manage in-game events:

- **Start an Event:** `/event start` – Starts a new event.
- **Toggle Scoreboard (on):** `/event lb on` – Enables the event scoreboard.
- **Toggle Scoreboard (off):** `/event lb off` – Disables the event scoreboard.
- **Set Prize:** `/event vyhra <prize>` – Sets the prize for the event.
- **End an Event:** `/event end` – Ends the current event.
- **Revive a Player:** `/event revive <player>` – Revives a player who died during the event.
- **Teleport Alive Players:** `/event tp alive` – Teleports all alive players to you.
- **Teleport Dead Players:** `/event tp dead` – Teleports all dead players to you.
